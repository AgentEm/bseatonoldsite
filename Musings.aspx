<h2>The Achill Island Essays</h2>

<p>During February and March 1996, I spent 40 days on Achill Island on the west coast of Ireland. It was a personal retreat that coincided with my 40th birthday on February 29, 1996. The retreat was the culmination of a 4 year journey looking at the universe, the world, and deep into myself. I wrote a number of short essays on subjects that meant a lot to me. Some of them are reprinted here.

<ol>
<li><asp:HyperLink runat="server" NavigateUrl="~/Musings/Achill01.aspx">Arrival</asp:HyperLink> - On the morning of my 40th birthday, I reflect on the outcome of my 4 year journey and the meaning of life.</li>

<li><asp:HyperLink runat="server" NavigateUrl="~/Musings/Achill02.aspx">Srebrenica</asp:HyperLink> - I react to my inaction during the summer of 1995 when I did nothing while a massacre was happening in Srebrenica. I live in hope that the war-crimes tribunal doesn't find out about my complicity with the perpetrators.</li>

<li><asp:HyperLink runat="server" NavigateUrl="~/Musings/Achill03.aspx">An Unwitting Oppressor</asp:HyperLink> - Could I be the beneficiary of systemic discrimination? Am I a hypocrite? Well...</li>

<li><asp:HyperLink runat="server" NavigateUrl="~/Musings/Achill06.aspx">Come Alive!</asp:HyperLink> - We're all here for a reason. We must find the reason that makes us want to come alive, because that is what the world needs.</li>

<li><asp:HyperLink runat="server" NavigateUrl="~/Musings/Achill07.aspx">Anyone Can Be A Prophet</asp:HyperLink> - find out how.</li>

<li><asp:HyperLink runat="server" NavigateUrl="~/Musings/Achill08.aspx">Take Off Your Shoes</asp:HyperLink> - If there was ever a first step in approaching the problems of our age, it is to take off our shoes.</li>

<li><asp:HyperLink runat="server" NavigateUrl="~/Musings/Achill09.aspx">A Glorious Sunset</asp:HyperLink> - Any serious discussion about the meaning of life needs to start with the consideration of death.</li>
