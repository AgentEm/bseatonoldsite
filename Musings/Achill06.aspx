<h2>Come Alive</h2>

<p>Do not ask what the world needs.  Rather ask what makes you come alive, then go and do it.  Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.</p>

<p>Each of us has been given a unique set of gifts and talents that make us different from those around us.  Some have a talent for art, music or theatre.  Others are natural born politicians or entrepreneurs.  Some are called to heal the sick, others to care for children.  Like individual tiles in a mosaic, the composite of our skills, abilities, talents and passions make up a grand and marvellous picture.</p>
				
<p>To find our individual purpose we must look deep into the centre of our being.  We must journey to the depths of our soul.  We must find that one activity, or set of activities that ignite fire in our hearts.  The things that give us joy.  The things that we love to do with passion.  The things that make us come alive.</p>

<p>If you love to sing, then your job is to sing.  Your purpose is to inspire and empower people through music and lyrics.  If you love running your own business, then you must strive to make it successful.  Be scrupulously honest in your business dealings.  Be fair to your employees.  Give generously to charity.  If you aspire to public service, then you must seek election, avoid corruption and fight to improve the conditions of our society and planet.  </p>

<p>If you can't do it full-time because of other responsibilities, then do it as an avocation or hobby.  Or bide your time.  Look for an opportunity to break out of your rut and commit totally to your true vocation.  Never, ever lose sight of those things that give meaning to your life.  It's why you are here.  No one else can do what you are destined to do.</p>

<p>Don't be discouraged by the odd setback.  Sometimes our timing is off.  Sometimes we fail.  But each attempt strengthens us and brings us closer to our goal.</p>

<p>Become part of your community by making your own unique contribution.  Participate in community actions: vote, protest, build, communicate, and help.  Quietly encourage others to do the same.  Don't forget that we're a team.  While each of us has our own position to play, we must support one another to be successful.  Give help to others generously.  Accept help graciously.</p>

<p>While our individual contribution is important, we're only one part of the puzzle.  We must ensure that our part fits seamlessly into the big picture; into that great mosaic of life.  Most important, we must come alive and enjoy, with the rest of humankind, every moment that life has to offer us.</p>
